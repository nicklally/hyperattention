##instructions
Copy the application to a folder and run it for 30+ minutes when you're working at your computer. When you're done, open the folder to see the files that have been created. No other files or data are saved or transmitted. 

##description (SPOILERS!)

They produce fascinating maps of how people use their computers as their private activity is laid bare.
